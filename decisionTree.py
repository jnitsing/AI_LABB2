# the DecisionFork constructor gets as a first element the attribut (e.g. the string from the perception) that causes the branching.
# The second element of the DecisionFork constructor is a dictionary that takes the different values (whatever type) in the
# example above it is a string "ok", "low" or "high". There is no restriction on data type, so it could be also a number.
# the entry that forms the value for the attribute-value-key is then again a DecisionFolk if the tree is branching further down
# or a DecisionLeaf if there is a result of the classification (action).
